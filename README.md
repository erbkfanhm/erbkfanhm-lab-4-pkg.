This project creates geometric shapes and computes their areas as well as respective statistics in regards to the various areas. It includes an abstract base class `Shape` and two more specific applications for `Square` and `Circle`. The function `area_stats` takes any number of shapes and returns a summary including total, mean, min, and max area.
